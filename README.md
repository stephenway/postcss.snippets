PostCSS [UltiSnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips) Snippets for Vim. Works great if you also have [vim-snippets](https://github.com/honza/vim-snippets) installed to cover most CSS properties.

## Install

`curl -o ~/.vim/UltiSnips/css.snippets
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stephenway/postcss.snippets/master/css.snippets`

If you cloned, simply use these quick make sub-commands.

* `make install` Copies the snippets file to your UltiSnips directory.
* `make uninstall` Removes the snippets file from your Ultinips directoy.
